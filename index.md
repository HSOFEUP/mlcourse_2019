### Computer requirement

All exercice will be in python. For instalation, we recomeand
(especially for mac) Anaconda (http://anaconda.org), more precisly
Python 3.7, with the following modules: numpy, scipy, matplotlib,
pandas, h5py, scikit-learn, scikit-image. All these can be installed
with anaconda.

For deep-learning, we shall use keras, tensorflow and pytorch.
All the exercices will be given as jupyter notebook, so these should be instaled as well.
